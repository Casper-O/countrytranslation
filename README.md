Uses the IP2Location™ Country Multilingual Database and will translate the country names to any of the 81 listed languages on their site:

http://www.ip2location.com/free/country-multilingual

#Translation rate
The database provided by IP2location™ contains 249 countries name in 81 languages. Prestashop have 244 countries in the system by default but there is only a match for 243 of them. Means this module will only translate 99.59% of them.

Missing is:

* AN (Netherlands Antilles)

# Use at own risk!
This module is really basic and really beta! The module config page is not ready at all and do not return anything regarding how successfull the translation was done! Since i started to make huge changes to the module I wanted to have it on github asap in case i messed up good working code. Use at own risk, but it has been tested with success on 1.6.1.X stores without any issues.
